# Hi there 👋
## Welcome to my repository!

* Technology when needed *

TikiNerds was coined by Roger Padayao. He was a friend, collaborator, and a foodie ally. I have been keeping his memory alive through these projects and digital presence.

I, on the other hand, is known as /snooyed/ in my community. I am an Arizona State University student going for a Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Information Technology. I was told that Uber pays for the tuition, so I decided to drive for Uber while doing my freelance gigs. I am also known for reading ~~hentai~~ educational webcomics and taking ~~very~~ long naps.
